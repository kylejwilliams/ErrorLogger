Project 01, cs4760

TO RUN PROGRAM:
---------------	
the program takes 4 command line arguments, as follows:
	-h, --help		displays a help message
	-n x			sets the number of error messages that you would like 
					logged to the file
					Default value: 42
	-l filename		sets the name that you would like the log saved to.
					Default value: logfile.txt
After execution, a file with the given name will be placed in your directory.
This file will contain the logged error messages in the following format:
'errLogger : [ date/time ] : [ error message]'

REFERENCE MATERIAL
------------------
A decent portion of the code for this project was able to be taken and adapted
from the 2nd Chapter of our textbook, most notably the 'listlib.h/.c' files. 

PRECAUTIONS
-----------
Due to time constraints, there are very few error handling procedures, and 
some of them are pretty dangerous. For instance, in getLog() where we are 
building a string from the logged error messages, I am not checking for 
realloc() failures and am directly reallocating memory of the 'main' string
and not a temporary one. While the program has been tested and runs 
successfully on Hoare, it has the potential to break spectacularly.

VERSION CONTROL
---------------
I utilized git rather than RCS. My git commit log and files can be found here:
